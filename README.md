## PHP Laravel study assignement.

Me and my partner made for university. It was also a project we still use today to few our progession made in uni.

The biggest challenge of this project was to figure out how Laravel handles the database migrations and how the code structure is setup.
Testing with Laravel Dusk was really convenient, we were able to get good tests in that we made use of to test our application for bugs.

The thing I would do differently next time, is actually making sure everything is possitioned correctly and make it a more feasible application that is user friendly and has all the accessebility that it requires for university students.
